Create a class called ChessVar to implement an abstract board game based on a chess variant known as Fog of War chess. The following rule explanation assumes you have some knowledge of standard chess rules, particularly regarding how the pieces move and capture. If you're unsure about any of these rules, feel free to reach out with questions.

The game starts with the standard chess setup. You'll need to track which player's turn it is, with white always moving first. Pieces move and capture the same way as in standard chess, but there are no checks, checkmates, castling, en passant, or pawn promotion. Like in standard chess, pawns can move two spaces forward on their first move, but only one space on subsequent moves. The game ends when a player's king is captured, and that player loses.

Locations on the board will be specified using "algebraic notation", with columns labeled a-h and rows labeled 1-8, as shown in this diagram:<img width="685" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 4 57 29 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5f0fc77-e2b5-48cc-b612-acbb19afadd4" />

Special rules for this variant of chess: Each player sees a different version of the board, where they can only view their own pieces and the squares their pieces can legally move to. If an opponent’s piece occupies one of these squares, it will be visible, as it can be captured. Hidden squares are clearly indicated to avoid confusion with visible empty squares. The objective is not to checkmate the king but to capture it. Players are not informed if their king is in check, and both staying in check or moving into check are legal moves, though they may result in the king being captured and losing the game.
